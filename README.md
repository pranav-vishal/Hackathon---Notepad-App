Do not worry about storing anything for now. If we refresh the page and everything is reset there is no issue.

Criteria of judgement:
- Responsive web app.
- Completeness. Try to see how many of the requirements you can complete.
- since it is the first hackathon are setting some guardrails for the beginners:
|| only use vanilla js (what you are learning these days). modules/libraries allowed. frameworks not allowed.  ||

Timeline:
- starts right now
- ends at 26th September 6pm IST. An announcement with a form link will be made at that point to submit your entry (link to deployed project. you can use heroku / netlify / GitHub pages for this)
- result will come by 30th September 6pm IST
